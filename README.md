# Handwriting-Digit-Recognition
I have done my industrial training in Webskitters Academy and i have done this project.

I have choose dataset which i will provide.
This dataset has 5 rows and 785 columns.
Dataset is also very good.
As my project is digit recognation so i used Random Forest Classifier for better result.
I got 96.3% accuracy using that algo.

I have tried to keep it vey simple that way anyone can understand the process.

Thanks.
